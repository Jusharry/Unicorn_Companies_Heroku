## Self Assessment Deliverable 

My objective when I started this course was unfocused as I really didnt know what Data Analysts did. I knew that it was a hot new field with a ton of open jobs and from word of mouth recommendations from friends and colleagues seemed like a way to break into a good to high paying tech job without the need for an expensive and long degree program. i quickly discovered that while different from traditional tech coding fields this industry is largely driven by people who are the foundation for what actually becomes the finished product in everything from the next recommended movie, to what shoes will do well in a particular region or with a specific demographic, to things as critical in predicting the imnpact of viruses ....Without good reliable data everything stops. 
I had to give up a lot to commit myself to the course including time with friends who I hadn't seen in a long time due to COVID but the desire to leave this pandemic in a more prepared and better equipped way kept me grounded. 
I learned that there are many different ways to solve problems and that the best way to solve a problem is to first decide what the outcome should look like and then formulate a plan around it. I also learned that starting from scratch isn't always necessary and that refactoring to suit a purpose is both efficient and productive.
My team for this project was very diverse and as such we encountered some difficulty in the early stages . Josh struggled early on with finding his place in the group but in the end produced a stellar [readme](https://github.com/Jusharry/Team_9_Final_Project/blob/4496de77912ff21a52c5f5864fa47379dacf2d52/README.md) which clearly outlined our project. Kajev was curious about the feasability of using a supervised model and also maybe predicting the trajectory of companies that werent yet unicorns with his India [model](https://github.com/Jusharry/Team_9_Final_Project/blob/4496de77912ff21a52c5f5864fa47379dacf2d52/India_startups.ipynb). Dhru also had a few issues with his sql [dataset](https://github.com/Jusharry/Team_9_Final_Project/blob/4496de77912ff21a52c5f5864fa47379dacf2d52/databasequery.sql) but persevered and produced a complete query sheet and last but not least Zeinab who works in marketing was tasked early on with the visualizations and she did not shy away from the challenge. She is solely responsible for the outstanding Tableau [dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/zeinab.homayounmher/viz/UnicornCompany_16492890602400/test?publish=yes). My strength in performing the technical [analysis](https://github.com/Jusharry/Team_9_Final_Project/blob/4496de77912ff21a52c5f5864fa47379dacf2d52/Unicorns_Evaluation.ipynb) also exposed an area of opportunity for me where I discovered that people skills are as important as analysis and that taking the time and patience to encourage others' growth bears great rewards. 
Finally thanks to the staff ; Insctructors, TA's and LA's they were very good at providing support.
